## 问题、提示
- 容器中为什么无法运行 systemd 进程？ #query 
	- [如何在Docker里面使用systemctl - Ehds](https://ehds.github.io/2021/01/21/docker_systemctl/)
## 主要笔记
- docker 通过 `--privileged=true` 和 `/usr/sbin/init` 共同启动特权容器，可以不用后面的命令，区别是：
    - 前者只是切换了 root 身份，但 Shell 环境仍然是普通用户的 Shell；而后者连用户和 Shell 环境一起切换成 root 身份了。
- 通常是为了使用 systemctl 而开启特权容器，原因是：
	- > That’s because “systemctl” talks to the systemd daemon by using the d-bus. In a container there is no systemd-daemon. Asking for a start will probably not quite do what you expect - the dev-mapping need to be a bit longer.
		- 容器里面是没有systemd进程的，所以不能正常开启systemctl。
	- 因为 docker只是提供了进程隔离，不是操作系统的虚拟。
		- This is by design. Docker should be running a process in the foreground in your container and it will be spawned as PID 1 within the container’s pid namespace. Docker is designed for process isolation, not for OS virtualization, so there are no other OS processes and daemons running inside the container (like systemd, cron, syslog, etc), only your entrypoint or command you run.  
		- If they included systemd commands, you’d find a lot of things not working since your entrypoint replaces init. Systemd also makes use to cgroups which docker restricts inside of containers since the ability to change cgroups could allow a process to escape the container’s isolation. Without systemd running as init inside your container, there’s no daemon to process your start and stop commands.
